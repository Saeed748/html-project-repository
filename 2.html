Unix was originally written in assembly language. Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL, based on his experience in the MULTICS project. B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewritten in C, developed into a large, complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system .<br>

The Unix-like family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including System V, BSD, and Linux. <br>The name "UNIX" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. <br>"UNIX-like" is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX.<br>

Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures.<br> They are used heavily for servers in business, as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments. Free UNIX variants, such as Linux and BSD, are popular in these areas.
